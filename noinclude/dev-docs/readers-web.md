# The Reader's Web

The Reader's Web is a new part of the browsable web where **content is separated from presentation**. It is similar in philosophy to RSS — the site owner provides only the content, while the reader's software decides how to style and display it — but unlike RSS it is part of the browsable web and supports visible connections between pages.

## Document Formats

There are three new standalone document formats and three equivalent embedded variants.

### Standalone Formats

| Format | Root element | Content | File extension |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **HDOC** | `<hdoc>` | HTML or plain text (no scripts, no styles) | `.hdoc` |
| **CDOC** | `<cdoc>` | An SVG image (a collage) | `.cdoc` |
| **CONDOC** | `<condoc>` | A connection-only document that loads another site's page as the main doc | `.condoc` |

**HDOC** is the primary text document type. It is XML-based, script-free, style-free. Structure: `<metadata>`, `<header>`, `<fallback>`, `<content>` (HTML/text), `<panels>`, `<copy-info>`, `<connections>`.

**CDOC** content is an SVG image (a collage). Connections attach to specific coordinate points on the SVG.

**CONDOC** loads an external URL as the left-panel document and connects it with visible connections to pages on the right. It allows annotating any third-party page with connections without modifying it.

### Embedded Variants

Embedded versions **piggyback on regular HTML pages** — they serve both ordinary visitors and HDOC-aware clients from the same URL:

- **Embedded HDOC** — the HTML page contains a `<div class="hdoc-content">` with the main content and a `<script type="application/json" id="hdoc-data">` block with structured metadata (header, panels, connections, removal-selectors).
- **Embedded CDOC** — the reader template embeds the CDOC source in a `<script type="application/json" id="cdoc-source">` tag.
- **Embedded CONDOC** — same pattern, using `id="condoc-source"`.

### Visible Connections

Documents connect to each other using **visible connections** (called "floating links" or "flinks" in the code). A connection specifies:
- The **target document URL**
- The **source anchor** (a text range in an HDOC, or an x/y point in a CDOC)
- The **destination anchor** (text range in the target HDOC, or point in a target CDOC)

The main document is shown on the left; any connected documents open in tabs on the right (within the reader UI, not regular browser tabs).
